## Quick Start

### Install from OSS

The distribution root is the public host plus its OSS prefix, without a trailing slash, for example `https://static.guance.com/skills`. It is always passed explicitly so the same artifacts and indexes can be copied to another brand's OSS unchanged.

Shell one-line install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://static.guance.com/skills/install.sh | sh -s -- \
  --base-url https://static.guance.com/skills \
  --skill otel-instrument \
  --agent codex \
  --scope user \
  --yes
```

PowerShell one-line install:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod 'https://static.guance.com/skills/install.ps1'))) `
  -BaseUrl 'https://static.guance.com/skills' `
  -Skill 'otel-instrument' `
  -Agent 'codex' `
  -Scope user `
  -Yes
```

Omit `--skill`/`-Skill` or `--agent`/`-Agent` in an interactive terminal to select from a menu. Non-interactive use must specify a skill (or `--all`/`-All`) and an agent; `--dest`/`-Dest` can replace the built-in agent path. The installers support `--scope project`, a pinned `--version <commit-sha>`, `--upgrade`, and guarded `--force` replacement. Setup code never runs by default; `--run-setup` only executes a platform-specific command explicitly declared in `skills-manifest.json`, shows it first, and asks for confirmation unless `--yes` is also present.

Supported adapters use the same name with `--agent <name>` in Shell and `-Agent <name>` in PowerShell:

| Coding agent | Agent name | User scope | Project scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | `codex` | `~/.codex/skills` | `.agents/skills` |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `~/.claude/skills` | `.claude/skills` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/skills` | `.opencode/skills` |
| Pi | `pi` | `~/.pi/agent/skills` | `.pi/skills` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini` | `~/.gemini/skills` | `.gemini/skills` |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot` | `~/.copilot/skills` | `.github/skills` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `~/.cursor/skills` | `.cursor/skills` |
| Amp | `amp` | `~/.config/agents/skills` | `.agents/skills` |
| Kimi Code | `kimi` | `~/.kimi-code/skills` | `.kimi-code/skills` |
| Qoder | `qoder` | `~/.qoder/skills` | `.qoder/skills` |
| ZCode | `zcode` | `~/.zcode/skills` | `.zcode/skills` |
| Shared Agent Skills convention | `agents` | `~/.agents/skills` | `.agents/skills` |

The Shell installer supports `curl` or `wget` and does not require Python or `jq`. It uses `.tar.gz`; PowerShell 5.1+ uses `.zip`. Both verify SHA-256 before extraction.

To check and upgrade one installed skill, rerun its installer with `--upgrade`/`-Upgrade`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/install.sh | sh -s -- \
  --base-url https://skills.example.com/ai-skills \
  --skill otel-instrument \
  --agent codex \
  --upgrade
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod 'https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/install.ps1'))) `
  -BaseUrl 'https://skills.example.com/ai-skills' `
  -Skill 'otel-instrument' `
  -Agent 'codex' `
  -Upgrade
```

The installer reads the release index first. If the installed version is current, it exits successfully without downloading an archive or prompting. If a newer version exists, a single explicitly selected skill upgrades without requiring `--yes`/`-Yes`; locally modified content is still refused unless `--force`/`-Force` is supplied. Upgrade mode requires an existing installation. The force flag directly replaces an existing installation, including locally modified or same-version content, and does not require the upgrade flag. `--yes`/`-Yes` remains useful for approving an initial non-interactive install, an `--all` operation, or a separately requested setup command.

### Uninstall

Download the uninstaller from the same distribution root used for installation. Unlike the installer, the uninstaller does not need `--base-url`/`-BaseUrl` because it operates only on local installation metadata.

Remove one user-scoped skill on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- \
  --skill otel-instrument \
  --agent codex \
  --scope user \
  --yes
```

Remove the same skill on Windows:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod 'https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/uninstall.ps1'))) `
  -Skill 'otel-instrument' `
  -Agent 'codex' `
  -Scope user `
  -Yes
```

For a project-scoped installation, run the command from the project or provide its path explicitly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- \
  --skill otel-instrument \
  --agent codex \
  --scope project \
  --project-dir /path/to/project \
  --yes
```

Use `--dest <skills-directory>`/`-Dest <skills-directory>` instead of `--agent`/`-Agent` to remove a skill from a custom installation root. Omit the skill or agent in an interactive terminal to select it from a menu. Non-interactive use must specify a skill (or `--all`/`-All`) and a destination adapter, and normally uses `--yes`/`-Yes` to skip the removal confirmation.

To remove every installer-managed skill from the selected destination, replace `--skill otel-instrument` with `--all` or use `-All` in PowerShell. `--all` never includes unmanaged directories.

#### Uninstall safety

The uninstallers validate every selected skill before removing anything:

- The skill directory must contain installer-generated `.skill-install.json` metadata. Unmanaged directories are refused even with `--force`/`-Force`.
- Symbolic-link and Windows reparse-point skill directories are refused so the uninstaller cannot follow them outside the selected destination.
- Missing, added, or changed installed files count as local modifications. The default action is to stop without deleting the skill.
- `--force`/`-Force` permits removal of a locally modified managed skill. It does not bypass the unmanaged-directory or link checks.
- All selected directories are moved transactionally before deletion. A move failure restores already moved directories, but a successful uninstall creates no backup and cannot be undone by the script.

Review local modifications before using force:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skills.example.com/ai-skills/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- \
  --skill otel-instrument \
  --agent codex \
  --force \
  --yes
```

After uninstalling, start a new coding-agent session if the current session has already loaded the removed skill into memory.

Prepare metrics CSV files such as:

```text
csv/mysql.csv
csv/redis.csv
csv/volcengine_kafka.csv
```

Recommended CSV columns include:

- `metric_name`
- `data_type`
- `unit`
- `tag_key` or `Tag`

Example:

```csv
metric_name,data_type,unit,tag_key
cpu_util,float,percent,host
memory_util,float,percent,host
```

Standard resource dashboards also require a resource-catalog or custom-object CSV/JSON export. The object input must identify the measurement/class and contain at least one real object record with queryable top-level fields, types, and values. Without that input, the skill must request an object export instead of fabricating an instance-property table from metric tags. It may continue with a telemetry-only dashboard only when the user explicitly accepts the missing resource table.

Use the skills in a skill-aware chat environment, for example:

```text
/skill dashboard
Generate a MySQL dashboard.

/skill monitor
Generate Redis monitors.

/skill dql
Fix this DQL and return an executable version.
```

## Mandatory Rules

- `dashboard` and `monitor` must refuse generation when the required CSV file is missing.
- Do not invent metrics and do not replace user CSV content with online examples.
- A standard resource dashboard must build its instance-property table from real resource-object data; metric tags are not a substitute.
- Any final executable DQL must pass `dqlcheck` item by item before delivery.
- Failed DQL should be minimally repaired and rechecked; an item that still fails after repeated attempts must not be delivered as final.

Common validation commands:

```bash
./dql/bin/dqlcheck -q '<DQL>'
./dql/bin/dqlcheck --file /tmp/query.dql
```

## Grafana Converter

The Grafana converter is self-contained under `grafana-to-guance-dashboard/` and includes scripts, schemas, fixtures, tests, and `package.json`.

```bash
cd grafana-to-guance-dashboard
npm install
npm run convert -- --input ./fixtures/grafana-dashboard.json --output ./output/guance-dashboard.json --validate
npm run validate:file -- ./output/guance-dashboard.json
npm test
```

Runtime requirement: Node.js 18 or newer.

## RUM Instrumentation

`rum-instrument` detects every deployable RUM target, reviews existing instrumentation, infers platform-specific configuration, and creates a revisioned plan before changing application code. The user only needs to provide the matching RUM Application ID and receiver source variables. Authorization comes from the request verb; there is no extra `approvalMode` variable.

Plan and implement a Public DataWay integration in one Prompt:

```text
使用 $rum-instrument 规划并实施当前仓库的 RUM 接入。

datawayUrl: {{DATAWAY_URL}}
appId: {{APP_ID}}
applicationType: {{APPLICATION_TYPE}} # optional
temporaryAuthCode: <paste the temporary authorization code>
```

Plan and implement a DataKit integration:

```text
使用 $rum-instrument 规划并实施当前仓库的 RUM 接入。

datakitUrl: {{DATAKIT_URL}}
appId: {{APP_ID}}
applicationType: {{APPLICATION_TYPE}} # optional
```

Use `plan`, `audit`, or read-only `validate` when the desired result is only a pending plan or report. Use `implement`, `integrate`, `repair`, or `plan and implement` to authorize ordinary core-RUM repository changes in the same run.

For React Native, Flutter mobile, UniApp Native, Unity, or a monorepo with multiple independently deployed applications, map IDs by platform instead of reusing one ID:

```yaml
appId:
  web: {{WEB_APP_ID}}
  android: {{ANDROID_APP_ID}}
  ios: {{IOS_APP_ID}}
```

For Public DataWay, planning needs only `datawayUrl` and `appId`; the helper matches the receiver to a supported official site catalog without consuming a temporary authorization code. The only built-in test mapping is `http://testing-openway.dataflux.cn` to `https://testing-ft2x-ai-api.dataflux.cn`; operational configuration is never loaded from `evals/`. For a one-Prompt implementation, include the one-time code directly in `temporaryAuthCode`. After the stable plan passes validation, the helper verifies the Token/state sinks and performs credential-free DataWay/AI API reachability checks before reading the code. It exchanges the code once, calls `/api/v1/rum/app/get` once per Application ID, and accepts a non-empty Client Token exactly when `token_expired` is false; sync/mapping fields are observations only and do not trigger polling. The helper atomically creates or updates a reviewed dotenv, JSON, properties, or xcconfig runtime/build sink, preserves unrelated entries, and writes separate digest-bound, non-secret execution state without changing the plan revision. `temporaryAuthCode: env:RUM_TEMP_AUTH_CODE` remains supported for automation. `clientToken` and `aiApiEndpoint` do not belong in the standard prompt.

The Skill infers platform, entry point, `service`, `version`, environment source, sampling, and core privacy controls from the repository. It analyzes optional Logs, Trace, Replay, WebView, native reliability signals, Remote Config, Canvas Replay, and release artifacts only when already present or explicitly requested. User-defined `applicationType` wins; otherwise authorized Public DataWay implementation uses AI API metadata, with repository detection as the fallback. DataKit skips the control plane; unknown collector or runtime reachability permits local implementation but remains a warning/handoff and prevents a claim of remote ingestion. An explicit implementation request continues automatically after a safe plan is validated. A plan-only request—or an implementation containing ambiguous IDs, type conflicts, dirty overlap, dependency upgrades/replacements, new optional signals/artifacts, test exceptions, unsafe Token sinks, remote mutations, or material scope drift—stops for review. Revision Review is bound to the canonical plan digest and any approved dirty-file digest; changing either invalidates approval. Generate `.rum/instrumentation.json` only when requested or when the repository already maintains one. Approve an exact pending revision with:

```text
Use $rum-instrument to implement .rum/plan.json revision 1.
```

The Skill never copies one scalar Application ID to multiple independent applications, exposes a temporary code, API Key, or Public DataWay Client Token to Agent-visible output, edits generated output, uploads Sourcemaps/symbols, or claims remote ingestion without evidence.

## OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

Give a coding agent this basic prompt. Replace the distribution URL, agent adapter, and upload URL, but do not include the credential value:

```text
Install the otel-instrument skill and use it to instrument the current project with OpenTelemetry.

Shell installer:
curl -fsSL <distribution-base-url>/install.sh | sh -s -- --base-url <distribution-base-url> --skill otel-instrument --agent <current-agent> --scope user --yes

If running on Windows PowerShell, use:
& ([scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod '<distribution-base-url>/install.ps1'))) -BaseUrl '<distribution-base-url>' -Skill 'otel-instrument' -Agent '<current-agent>' -Scope user -Yes

Upload the selected telemetry signals over OTLP HTTP/protobuf to:
<otel-upload-url>

Credential environment variable format:
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <tenant-token>"
```

The human should replace `<tenant-token>` only in their own shell, service manager, container/Kubernetes secret, or CI secret UI. The agent must not receive the completed value. Because OTLP exporter header parsing can require W3C Baggage encoding, the skill adapts the final placeholder command to the selected SDK; for example, it may render the header value as `Authorization=Bearer%20<tenant-token>` while the resulting HTTP header remains `Authorization: Bearer <tenant-token>`.

When the repository has existing deployment configuration—such as Kubernetes/Helm/Kustomize, Docker Compose, Dockerfile, systemd, or application startup config—the skill treats it as part of instrumentation and automatically adds the approved non-secret OTel setup there. It validates the rendered/effective configuration and falls back to environment settings or a launch command only when no tracked configuration entry exists.

The setup uses `http/protobuf`, the signal-specific paths `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, and `/v1/logs`, and an `Authorization: Bearer <tenant-token>` header supplied at runtime. The skill may wire an already-existing secret reference, but it never invents a secret, writes a token into tracked files, or exchanges, generates, reads, or persists tenant tokens.

The skill treats attributes emitted by automatic HTTP instrumentation as untrusted. It requires URL sanitization plus exported-attribute negative tests for query credentials, dynamic paths, object keys, and unknown routes while separately proving that the real network request and context propagation remain unchanged.

## Release to Alibaba Cloud OSS

`skills-manifest.json` is the distribution registry. Every top-level directory containing `SKILL.md` must have exactly one entry; the build fails on missing or stale entries. Optional setup commands use executable-plus-argument arrays instead of Shell strings:

```json
{
  "name": "example-skill",
  "path": "example-skill",
  "setup": {
    "unix": ["npm", "install"],
    "windows": ["npm.cmd", "install"]
  }
}
```

Build and validate deterministic artifacts locally:

```bash
./release.sh --dry-run --output ./dist/skills-release
```

Publishing is performed on every push to `main`, with `workflow_dispatch` available for an idempotent recovery run. The workflow publishes immutable `versions/<commit-sha>/...` objects first and updates `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.sh`, `uninstall.ps1`, `skills-index.json`, and `skills-index.tsv` last. Versioned objects use a one-year immutable cache policy; stable entrypoints use `no-cache`. CI then downloads every public file and verifies its SHA-256.

Configure these GitHub repository settings:

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Dedicated least-privilege RAM user AccessKey ID |
| Secret | `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | Dedicated least-privilege RAM user AccessKey Secret |
| Variable | `OSS_REGION` | Region ID required by ossutil V4 signing, such as `cn-hangzhou` |
| Variable | `OSS_ENDPOINT` | Public OSS API endpoint used by GitHub-hosted runners |
| Variable | `OSS_BUCKET` | Destination bucket name |
| Variable | `OSS_PREFIX` | Object prefix, such as `ai-skills` |
| Variable | `OSS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Anonymous HTTPS download scheme and host only, without prefix or trailing slash |

The publish script maps the GitHub secrets to ossutil's `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` environment variables and never accepts credentials as command-line arguments. It downloads the official ossutil 2.3.0 archive and verifies the vendor-published checksum before upload. The bucket/prefix must grant anonymous HTTPS read while the RAM user is limited to writes in that bucket/prefix. Enable bucket versioning and configure OSS lifecycle rules for historical SHA paths; the release job never deletes an old version.

For another brand, synchronize the complete prefix without rewriting its files. The brand's installation command passes that mirror's full distribution root through `--base-url` or `-BaseUrl`, and relative paths in both indexes keep all downloads on the selected mirror.
