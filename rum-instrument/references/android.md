# Android adapter

Primary-source registry: `official-sources.json#android`.

## Detect

Confirm Android application modules from the Android Gradle plugin, `AndroidManifest.xml`, application module build files, and real release variants. Distinguish independently released apps from Android subprojects owned by React Native, Flutter, UniApp, or Unity.

Inspect existing `ft-sdk`, `ft-plugin`, `ft-native`, `FTSDKConfig`, RUM/Log/Trace builders, `Application.onCreate`, Content Provider initialization, WebView integration, and mapping/native-symbol tasks.

## Plan

Verify current Maven coordinates, plugin/SDK compatibility, AGP/Gradle/Kotlin/Java requirements, minimum Android version, and selected release from the official guide/repository. Do not write `[latest_version]` or guess a version.

Map the normalized receiver and Android Application ID through the selected SDK's current configuration APIs. Initialize at the documented application lifecycle point exactly once. Decide explicitly whether automatic startup, Activity/Fragment, click, network, WebView, Logcat, and native-crash capabilities require `ft-plugin` or optional packages.

Preserve existing OkHttp/interceptor behavior. Avoid adding both plugin and manual collection for the same boundary.

## Privacy and artifacts

Review Android privacy/permission declarations and official desensitization hooks. Do not collect view text, EditText content, request bodies, complete URLs, or unbounded custom properties.

Plan R8/ProGuard mapping and native symbols against the exact variant/version/build ID. Keep upload credentials outside Gradle files and do not upload without authorization.

## Validation

Run the module's Gradle unit/lint/build tasks for the selected variants. Verify:

- one SDK initialization during application startup;
- correct Application ID per variant/flavor;
- Activity/Fragment/View and network behavior without duplicate events;
- trace headers only on allowlisted hosts;
- WebView/native bridge does not duplicate browser RUM;
- mapping/native symbols match the built artifact;
- privacy canaries are absent.
