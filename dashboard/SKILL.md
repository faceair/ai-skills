# Guance Dashboard Generation Skill

Generate Guance Dashboard JSON from real metrics CSV files. Standard resource dashboards also use resource-catalog or custom-object data for instance-property tables. When the user provides a manually edited Dashboard JSON, treat it as feedback and carry its verified corrections into unfinished charts.

This skill must produce an operations-usable dashboard, not a thin demo. The final output must be based only on the user-provided CSV metrics and every final DQL must pass `dqlcheck`.

## Reference Routing

- Read [Dashboard JSON Contract](references/dashboard-json-contract.md) when generating or repairing JSON fields, units, layout, or style.
- Read [Custom Group Color Blocks](references/group-color-blocks.md) when assigning, repairing, or reviewing Dashboard group-header colors.
- Read [Query Semantics and Readability](references/query-semantics.md) when classifying counters, gauges, pre-aggregated fields, overview queries, or trend grouping.
- Read [Snapshot Chart Import and Save Round Trip](references/snapshot-chart-roundtrip.md) when generating or repairing `hexgon`, `treemap`, `toplist`, scalar `singlestat`, or metric `table` charts, or when an imported chart becomes correct only after the user clicks Save.
- Read [Resource Object Tables](references/resource-object-tables.md) when object data is present or an instance-property table and value mappings are required.
- Read [Official Field Research](references/official-field-research.md) and consult first-party sources when units, status, mode, billing, capacity, or boolean semantics are unclear.

## Workflow

```text
Input: csv/{{type}}*.csv plus tag metadata
       resource-object CSV/JSON for a standard resource dashboard
       optional manually edited Dashboard JSON
        ->
   [Check real inputs] <- refuse generation when metrics CSV is missing
        ->               <- request object export when a standard resource table is required
   [Parse metrics, tags, and object top-level fields]
        ->
   [Research official units and enum semantics]
        ->
   [Apply operations baseline]
        ->
     [Generate JSON]
        ->
   [Autofix style] <- required before DQL validation
        ->
   [Validate DQL] <- validate one query at a time
        ->
Output: output/dashboard/{{type}}/{{type}}.json
```

## Mandatory Rules

### Step 1: CSV File Check

Before generation, the skill must verify that at least one matching CSV file exists:

- `csv/{{type}}*.csv`
- `csv/{{type}}.csv`
- `csv/{{type}}/*.csv`

If no CSV file exists, refuse generation.

Do not:

- Invent metrics from memory or from the internet.
- Use sample metrics as a substitute for the user's CSV.
- Generate a dashboard without CSV input.
- Omit unit configuration from chart outputs.

### Step 1A: Resource Object Check

A standard resource dashboard must build its instance-property table from resource-catalog or custom-object CSV/JSON data. The object input must provide:

- the object measurement or class
- at least one real object record rather than only a field template
- queryable top-level fields with real types and values
- readable account or instance names and a stable instance identifier, or the product's equivalent fields

When object input is missing:

1. do not create or modify an instance-property table
2. do not assemble a fake resource table from metric tags
3. stop standard resource-dashboard generation and request an object export
4. continue with a telemetry-only dashboard only after the user explicitly accepts the missing resource table and document that exception

A review-only task that does not modify an existing object table may proceed without object input. Any new object field, unit, or enum mapping still requires a real object sample.

### Step 2: Parse CSV Fields

Read these fields from the CSV with either Chinese or English column names:

- `指标名` or `metric_name`
- `字段类型` or `data_type`
- `单位` or `unit`
- `操作` or `tag_key` or `Tag`

The parsed tag field is the source of truth for variable naming.

Also classify:

- raw counters, raw gauges, and cloud-side pre-aggregated values
- related `_average`, `_max`, and `_min` metric families
- additive quantities, ratios, utilization, latency, capacity, and status fields
- readable account and instance names, stable instance IDs, and node or shard dimensions

For object data, capture the class, top-level fields, sample values, field types, unit metadata, and low-cardinality enum candidates. Nested `message` payloads are evidence sources only; do not assume their fields are queryable top-level `CO::` fields.

### Step 3: Derive Variable Code From CSV

The variable `code` must come from the actual CSV tag keys. Do not rename tags by datasource convention.

Prefer readable filters and stable identity when the actual fields exist:

1. a readable account field such as `account_name`
2. a readable instance field such as `instance_name`
3. a stable instance field such as `instance_id`
4. otherwise use the real `instanceId`, `host`, or first parsed tag without renaming it
5. fall back to `host` only when no tag exists

Example logic:

```python
def get_variable_codes(csv_row):
    tag_text = csv_row.get("操作") or csv_row.get("tag_key") or csv_row.get("Tag") or ""
    tags = [t.strip() for t in tag_text.split(",") if t.strip()]

    preferred = [
        key for key in ["account_name", "instance_name", "instance_id", "instanceId", "host"]
        if key in tags
    ]

    return preferred or tags[:1] or ["host"]
```

Consistency is mandatory:

- validate every entry in `main.vars` rather than assuming `main.vars[0]` is the only variable
- every DQL variable reference must resolve to an actual variable code
- every filter `name` and `value` must match its actual variable and `#{code}`
- `groupBy` must match the DQL `BY` display dimensions
- filter dimensions do not all need to appear in `BY`; readable names belong in legends while stable IDs may remain filters or object grouping keys

### Step 4: Operations Coverage Baseline

The dashboard must be useful for troubleshooting, not just overview display.

Minimum requirements for every dashboard:

- at least 1 instance-level `table` chart; for a standard resource dashboard this must query real object data
- at least 1 row of `singlestat` KPI cards, usually 4 to 8 cards
- at least 6 `sequence` trend charts

If CSV coverage exists, do not silently skip important dimensions unless they are explicitly low-value and you say so.

MySQL-specific minimums when matching CSV files exist:

- `mysql`: include connection, query, transaction, and network trends
- `mysql_user_status`: include at least 1 user-dimension table with `BY host, user`
- `mysql_schema`: include at least 1 schema-dimension table with `BY host, schema_name`
- `mysql_table_schema`: include at least 1 table-dimension table with `BY host, table_schema, table_name`
- `mysql_replication`: include at least 1 replication-related chart

Do not:

- ship only overview cards
- drop user/schema/table views when the CSV supports them
- force static capacity, architecture, status, or creation-time fields into telemetry summary cards; put them in the resource-object table

## Style Autofix

Autofix is required after JSON generation and before DQL validation.

### Required Autofix Actions

1. Set every `dashboardExtend.groupUnfoldStatus` entry to `true`.
2. Put the overview group first.
3. Put list-style groups immediately after overview.
4. Remove `dashboardExtend.groupColor`.
5. For portable custom group color blocks, set `main.groups[].extend.bgColor` to a light solid `#RRGGBB` value from the recommended 10-color operations palette and set `isExpanded` to match the intended default state. Do not use editor-normalized RGBA values in an import artifact.
6. Remove `main.groups[].extend.colorKey` when using custom `bgColor`; do not mix built-in color keys with the custom-color domain.
7. For overview `singlestat` charts, force `extend.settings.valueColor` from a varied palette.
8. For overview `singlestat` charts, force `extend.settings.bgColor` to a transparent background derived from `valueColor`.
9. For overview `singlestat` charts, force `extend.settings.borderColor = "#E5E7EB"`.
10. For a grouped `sequence` query that returns multiple series, clear the query color and `settings.colors` so the UI palette can distinguish those series.
11. Write back the autofixed JSON and use that result for final validation.
12. Apply the snapshot-chart round-trip contract to `hexgon`, `treemap`, `toplist`, scalar `singlestat`, and metric `table` charts; never copy workspace-generated series colors or import metadata.

Reference pseudocode:

```python
def to_alpha_bg(hex_color, alpha=0.12):
    h = hex_color.lstrip("#")
    r, g, b = int(h[0:2], 16), int(h[2:4], 16), int(h[4:6], 16)
    return f"rgba({r}, {g}, {b}, {alpha})"

def autofix_dashboard_style(dashboard):
    groups = [g["name"] for g in dashboard["main"]["groups"]]
    dashboard["dashboardExtend"]["groupUnfoldStatus"] = {name: True for name in groups}

    list_groups = [g for g in groups if "list" in g.lower() and g.lower() != "overview"]
    other_groups = [g for g in groups if g not in (["overview"] + list_groups)]
    ordered = (["overview"] if "overview" in groups else []) + list_groups + other_groups

    group_palette = [
        "#60A5FA", "#38BDF8", "#94A3B8", "#4ADE80", "#FBBF24",
        "#22D3EE", "#818CF8", "#F87171", "#FB923C", "#2DD4BF",
    ]
    multi = ["#06B6D4", "#10B981", "#EAB308", "#F97316", "#EF4444", "#8B5CF6", "#EC4899"]

    dashboard["dashboardExtend"].pop("groupColor", None)

    order_index = {name: idx for idx, name in enumerate(ordered)}
    dashboard["main"]["groups"].sort(key=lambda group: order_index[group["name"]])
    dashboard["main"]["charts"].sort(
        key=lambda chart: order_index.get(
            chart.get("group", {}).get("name", ""), len(order_index)
        )
    )

    for idx, group in enumerate(dashboard["main"]["groups"]):
        ext = group.setdefault("extend", {})
        ext["bgColor"] = group_palette[idx % len(group_palette)]
        ext["isExpanded"] = dashboard["dashboardExtend"]["groupUnfoldStatus"].get(group["name"], True)
        ext.pop("colorKey", None)

    card_idx = 0
    for chart in dashboard["main"]["charts"]:
        settings = chart.setdefault("extend", {}).setdefault("settings", {})
        group_name = chart.get("group", {}).get("name", "")
        if chart.get("type") == "singlestat" and group_name.lower() == "overview":
            settings["valueColor"] = multi[card_idx % len(multi)]
            settings["bgColor"] = to_alpha_bg(settings["valueColor"], 0.14)
            settings["borderColor"] = "#E5E7EB"
            card_idx += 1
        if chart.get("type") == "sequence":
            for item in chart.get("queries", []):
                if item.get("query", {}).get("groupBy"):
                    item["color"] = ""
                    settings["colors"] = []

    return dashboard
```

## Core JSON Rules

### Base Structure

The generated JSON must follow this shape:

```json
{
  "title": "MySQL Monitoring",
  "dashboardType": "CUSTOM",
  "dashboardExtend": {
    "groupUnfoldStatus": {}
  },
  "dashboardMapping": [],
  "dashboardOwnerType": "node",
  "dashboardBindSet": [],
  "thumbnail": "",
  "summary": "Description",
  "main": {
    "vars": [],
    "charts": [],
    "groups": []
  }
}
```

Do not put `chartGroupPos` inside `main`.

### Variable Definition

Use the real tag key in the variable definition and downstream queries.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Host",
  "code": "host",
  "type": "QUERY",
  "definition": {
    "value": "SHOW_TAG_VALUE(from=['mysql'],keyin=['host'])[10m]"
  },
  "multiple": true,
  "includeStar": true
}
```

### Groups

Groups are required under `main.groups`.

Rules:

- overview first
- list groups second when present
- trend and detail groups after that
- every group should have `extend.bgColor`

## Units

Every chart must configure units.

If the CSV or object schema does not provide a unit, research the current service's first-party API, metric, or SDK documentation. Use `["custom", ""]` and mark the result `UNVERIFIED` only when the unit still cannot be confirmed. Otherwise map it to a standard pair.

Recommended mappings:

| CSV unit | units |
|---|---|
| `-` | `["custom", ""]` |
| `percent` | `["percent", "percent"]` |
| `%` | `["percent", "percent"]` |
| `B` | `["digital", "B"]` |
| `KB` | `["digital", "KB"]` |
| `MB` | `["digital", "MB"]` |
| `GB` | `["digital", "GB"]` |
| `B/S` | `["traffic", "B/S"]` |
| `KB/S` | `["traffic", "KB/S"]` |
| `MB/S` | `["traffic", "MB/S"]` |
| `ms` | `["time", "ms"]` |
| `s` | `["time", "s"]` |
| `iops` | `["throughput", "iops"]` |
| `ops` | `["throughput", "ops"]` |
| `reqps` | `["throughput", "reqps"]` |

Only use `custom` when the unit is actually empty or remains unrecognized after research. Distinguish bytes from bits, ratios from percentages, cumulative values from rates, and instance totals from node or shard values.

## Chart Rules

### Singlestat Rules

Use `singlestat` for overview KPIs.

Required behavior:

- use the final DQL directly, without wrapping it in `series_sum(...)`
- keep the final DQL grouped by the variable code when the chart needs grouped source data
- use `fill = null`
- use `funcList = []`
- use `fieldFunc = "last"`
- do not use rollup syntax here
- do not aggregate with `AVG()` or `SUM()` directly inside the core KPI field expression when a direct field is enough
- include units
- include outer query metadata fields such as `name`, `type`, `unit`, `color`, and `qtype`

Example validation commands:

```bash
./dql/bin/dqlcheck -q 'M::`mysql`:(`Threads_connected` AS `Connections`) { `host` = "#{host}" } BY `host`'
```

### Sequence Rules

Use `sequence` for trends.

Required behavior:

- counters should prefer rate or rollup-style logic where compatible
- if rollup causes rendering or compatibility problems, degrade to a simpler `fill(last(...), linear)` style query
- non-counters should usually use `AVG(field)`
- use `fill = "linear"`
- use `currentChartType = "area"`
- use `chartType = "areaLine"`
- use `funcList = []`
- use `queryFuncs = []`
- use `groupByTime = ""`
- use `fieldFunc = "last"` for rate-like counters
- use `fieldFunc = "avg"` for average-value metrics
- use `=` in filters, not regex operators
- include units

Do not add extra Grafana-style rendering flags that Guance does not need.

Choose the query from the metric's aggregation semantics:

| Metric kind | Preferred trend DQL | `fieldFunc` |
|---|---|---|
| Raw counter | `rate(field)` or compatible rollup logic | `last` |
| Raw gauge | `AVG(field)` | `avg` |
| Cloud-side `*_average` | `fill(last(field), linear)` | `last` |
| Cloud-side `*_max` / `*_min` | Use `fill(last(...), linear)` only when peak or floor analysis is explicitly needed | `last` |

Do not apply a second `AVG()` to already aggregated `*_average` fields. Default to the `_average` member of an `_average/_max/_min` family, keep one metric field per `queries[]` item, prefer readable instance names in ordinary multi-instance legends, and leave grouped-query colors empty so the UI can distinguish the returned series.

### Table Rules

Use `table` charts for instance lists and high-cardinality operational views.

At least one instance-level table is mandatory.

For metric tables, use a scalar `last(field)` snapshot query per metric, keep `fill = null`, and serialize `query.field` as a single-element array. Apply the stable metric-table defaults from the snapshot round-trip reference so imports render one current row per resource rather than one row per timestamp.

When the CSV supports richer dimensions, prefer:

- user-level tables
- schema-level tables
- table-level tables
- queue, tool, or operation top-N tables for runtime dashboards

For a standard resource dashboard, use a real custom-object query for the instance table:

```dql
CO::service_object:(last(`account_name`), last(`instance_name`), last(`region_id`), last(`status`)) { `account_name` = '#{account_name}' and `instance_id` = '#{instance_id}' } BY `instance_id`
```

Use `namespace: "custom_object"`, the real object measurement/class as `dataSource`, and a stable resource ID in `groupBy`. Query only top-level fields found in the object sample. Use verified `alias`/`fieldMapping` and `valMappings` for readable columns; preserve unknown values rather than guessing.

## Layout Rules

### Overview Cards

Preferred dimensions:

- height `h = 6`
- use full 24-column width

Recommended widths:

| cards per row | width |
|---|---|
| 8 | 3 |
| 6 | 4 |
| 4 | 6 |
| 3 | 8 |

If there are 6 cards in a row, use width `4` so the row spans the full dashboard width.

### Sequence Layout

Prefer stable layouts:

- 3 charts per row: `w = 8`, `h = 10`
- 4 charts per row: `w = 6`, `h = 10`
- 2 charts per row: `w = 12`, `h = 10`
- 1 chart per row: `w = 24`, `h = 10`

Default to 3 charts per row unless the group divides cleanly into 4.

### Table Layout

Tables should usually be full-width:

- `w = 24`
- `h = 10`

## DQL Validation

Every final chart DQL must pass `dqlcheck` one by one.

The only round-trip exception is a manually saved scalar snapshot whose canonical Dashboard DQL omits the binder-only time window. For that chart, validate a temporary proof form with an explicit duration, record both final and proof forms, and keep the saved canonical form in the Dashboard. This exception never applies to semantic Rollups such as `[10m:::last]`; those must remain in the final DQL.

Validation steps:

1. extract every final DQL from dashboard charts
2. validate each query individually
3. minimally repair failed queries and retry
4. keep only validated DQL, or a saved scalar canonical form with a validated explicit-window proof, in the final dashboard
5. report the total, passed, and failed query counts in the delivery notes

Commands:

```bash
./dql/bin/dqlcheck -q '<DQL>'
./dql/bin/dqlcheck --file /tmp/query.dql
```

Pass criteria:

- every DQL in every chart type passes, including `sequence`, `singlestat`, `table`, `hexgon`, `treemap`, and `toplist`

If a query still fails after repair attempts, say so explicitly and do not present it as a valid final result.

## Validation Checklist

- CSV file exists before generation.
- a standard resource dashboard has a real object class and at least one real object record.
- The dashboard JSON is structurally valid.
- `main.groups` exists.
- `main` does not contain `chartGroupPos`.
- style autofix has been applied before DQL validation.
- all groups are unfolded in `dashboardExtend.groupUnfoldStatus`.
- every custom group color uses a light solid `#RRGGBB` `bgColor`, has a matching `isExpanded` state, omits `colorKey`, and avoids pink or magenta hues; editor-normalized RGBA values are not used in portable import JSON.
- overview is the first group.
- list groups follow overview when present.
- variable code comes from the CSV tag field.
- every DQL variable reference resolves across all `main.vars` entries.
- every `filters.name` and `filters.value` matches an actual variable, and `groupBy` matches the DQL `BY` display dimensions.
- every chart has units configured.
- no `singlestat` uses `series_sum(...)`.
- every `singlestat` uses `fill = null`.
- every `sequence` uses valid fill and chart-type settings.
- every snapshot query wrapper has `queryGroup == query.code`.
- `hexgon`, `treemap`, and `toplist` snapshot DQL uses the round-trip contract and contains no `fill(`, `SORDER`, or `SLIMIT`.
- no portable `treemap` or `toplist` persists data-dependent series identities in `settings.colors`.
- every metric-table query uses single-element array `query.field` and stable snapshot-table settings.
- at least 1 instance table exists.
- a standard resource instance table uses `CO::`, `custom_object`, the real object class, and a stable resource ID.
- at least 1 overview KPI row exists.
- at least 6 trend charts exist.
- all final DQL has passed `dqlcheck`, or a manually saved scalar canonical form has an individually validated explicit-window proof.
- delivery notes report the DQL validation totals and result.
